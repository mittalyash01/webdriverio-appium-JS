# Introduction
This repository is setup to demonstrate the capabilities of [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) test automation framework. The team has setup WebDriverIO for mobile native app test automation with libraries/tools such as- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework, [Appium](https://appium.io) for mobile automation, [Allure Reporter](https://webdriver.io/docs/allure-reporter/) for robust reporting. We also demonstrated and compared the capabilities of integrating this framework with cloud execution environments such as- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/), [Perfecto](https://www.perfecto.io/), [UFT Mobile](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/uft-digital-lab/overview) and [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/).
