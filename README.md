# Mobile Hackathon: Introduction
This repository is setup as a part of Mobile Test automation hackathon to demonstrate the capabilities of [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) test automation framework. The team has setup WebDriverIO for mobile native app test automation with libraries/tools such as- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework, [Appium](https://appium.io) for mobile automation, [Allure Reporter](https://webdriver.io/docs/allure-reporter/) for robust reporting. We also demonstrated and compared the capabilities of integrating this framework with cloud execution environments such as- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/), [Perfecto](https://www.perfecto.io/) and [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/).

### Integrations
In this section we will elaborate the integration of the automation framework with various cloud execution environment/ device farm. We will showcase the capability of each combination as in-depth analysis of what went well and not, how we navigate through challenges and share some key metrics around each combination.

#### SauceLabs

[SauceLabs](https://www.saucelabs.com/) is a cloud-hosted web and mobile application automated testing platform. It provides a wide range of comprehensive test infrastructure for automated and manual testing of mobile applications using Selenium, Appium and JavaScript unit testing frameworks.

To install wdio saucelabs service run the command:
`npm install wdio-sauce-service --save-dev`

To execute test in SauceLabs, below configuration files can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/mittalyash01/webdriverio-appium-team1/tree/main/config/saucelabs) and username and Access key should be updated with SauceLabs credentials.

4. Able to use the same script for both Android and iOS testing with minor tweaks
 
##### Shortcoming 
    
1. High execution turnaround time. 3-5 x as compared to other solutions
2. Takes very long to open a tunnel connection (~ 30 seconds)
3. Doesnâ€™t support latest version of WebDriver IO 8
4. Need to set high timeout to prevent failing
5. Need to check device availability every time before executing tests- since these were shared/public devices over the cloud. 
6. The device management console is not present, could be better from usability point of view.
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    

#### AWS Device Farm
AWS Device Farm is an application testing service that lets you improve the quality of your web and mobile apps by testing them across an extensive range of desktop browsers and real mobile devices; without having to provision and manage any testing infrastructure. The service enables you to run your tests concurrently on multiple desktop browsers or real devices to speed up the execution of your test suite, and generates videos and logs to help you quickly identify issues with your app.

Unfortunately, AWS device farm currently doesn't support WebDriverIo native app executions. It supports only desktop broswer testing. Please refer to [docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/wdio-aws-device-farm-service/)
    
##### Positive outlook 

Not Applicable. We will update this section if this service is available in the future.
    
##### Shortcoming 
    
1. Need to upload the entire framework in zip format, there is no provision of tunnel execution through local or CI.
2. Very less documentation, support available.
3. Not a user friendly solution, could have done better.


## Executing your first test
### Execute on user local: 
 To execute test using this framework in your local machine, use following command:
    `npx wdio {config} --spec {filename}`
 
where:
- {config} refers to the [scripts](https://github.com/mittalyash01/webdriverio-appium-team1/tree/main/package.json)
- {filename} refers to the specific [test](https://github.com/mittalyash01/webdriverio-appium-team1/tree/main/test/specs). In case you wish to execute all tests under spec folder, please ignore this parameter.

### Execute over CI: 
 To execute test using CI (we use GitHub here). Follow below steps:
 - Push the framework code to the CI tool of your preference.
 - Set secrets/environment variables as mentioned in [configs](https://github.com/mittalyash01/webdriverio-appium-team1/tree/main/config) for each cloud vendor in use.
 - Navigate to Actions tab (if the tool supports gh-actions) and select the respective CI you wish to execute.
 - Provide appropriate parameters, click Run Workflow and voila!

 - Check test results in gh-pages [repository](https://github.com/mittalyash01/webdriverio-appium-team1/tree/gh-pages/browserstack-results)
and [Allure report](https://mittalyash01.github.io/webdriverio-appium-team1/browserstack-results/34/)
